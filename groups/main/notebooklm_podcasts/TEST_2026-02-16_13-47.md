This is a second test file to verify Google Drive sync is working properly.

## Quick Research Summary

Recent developments in GeoAI show promising applications for humanitarian health. Researchers are using machine learning combined with geospatial data to predict disease outbreaks, with some models achieving over 95% accuracy in malaria prediction across African regions.

The integration of foundation models represents a significant shift, enabling systems that can work with limited training data - crucial for humanitarian contexts where data is often scarce.

## Key Points

1. **Real-time Analysis**: Modern GeoAI systems can process satellite imagery and ground reports simultaneously
2. **Scalability**: Cloud-based platforms allow analysis at continental scale
3. **Accessibility**: Open-source tools are making these capabilities available to humanitarian organizations

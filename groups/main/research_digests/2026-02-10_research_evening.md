## GENERAL SUMMARY

### Current State of Research

The current state of GeoAI research in humanitarian health and disaster management demonstrates rapid growth and increasing sophistication, with AI applications in disaster management experiencing a 15.61% annual growth rate and significant publication increases beginning in 2019 [1]. Recent developments show that AI enhances GIS capabilities for predictive analysis, early warning systems, response coordination, and damage assessment, producing more accurate vulnerability and disaster risk management models than traditional methods [3]. The field is evolving from conventional machine learning approaches to embrace large-scale foundation models and generative AI, with researchers developing specialized geospatial models capable of analyzing complex geographic data and creating sophisticated thematic maps [5].

### Key Themes and Patterns

Six major research clusters have emerged in this domain: (1) disaster monitoring and prediction using IoT networks, (2) AI-based geospatial technology for risk management, (3) decision support systems for disaster emergency management, (4) social media analysis for emergency response, (5) machine learning algorithms for disaster risk reduction, and (6) big data and deep learning for disaster management [1]. For vector-borne disease management, GeoAI technologies enable real-time risk assessments and accelerated decision-making for spatial targeting of interventions, though as societies become more digitalized, the availability of geospatially enabled health information will require enhanced training to fully leverage these capabilities [2]. The integration of AI with GIS allows systems to process large datasets, identify patterns, and make accurate disaster predictions while providing real-time insights for more proactive and responsive public health interventions [4].

### Critical Gaps

However, CRITICAL GAPS remain in this rapidly advancing field. While AI enhances the integration of GIS and remote sensing, significant challenges persist including ensuring data accuracy and quality, addressing ethical considerations, and mitigating potential biases in algorithmic decision-making [3]. Training deficits represent a major barrier, as professionals need enhanced capacity to use geospatial information for disease management effectively [2]. The field faces a fundamental tension between technological advancement and human-centered approaches, with researchers emphasizing that human insights must remain at the forefront through mixed-experts GeoAI that integrates human expertise with AI systems [5]. Additionally, trust and ethical frameworks for human-robot interaction in dynamic service environments require further development to ensure responsible deployment of these technologies [5].

### Key Insights for PhD Research

For PhD research in GeoAI and humanitarian health, these findings suggest several key opportunities. The rapid growth trajectory indicates a fertile research landscape with increasing funding and publication opportunities, particularly in the six identified research clusters [1]. The shift toward foundation models and human-centered approaches creates space for methodological innovation that bridges technical advancement with ethical deployment [5]. Critical research gaps exist in developing training frameworks for practitioners, establishing robust ethical guidelines for algorithmic decision-making in humanitarian contexts [2,3], and creating systems that maintain human expertise at their core while leveraging AI's analytical power [5]. The convergence of climate change, disaster resilience, and GeoAI presents timely research opportunities, particularly for work that addresses data quality challenges and algorithmic bias in resource-constrained humanitarian settings [3,4].

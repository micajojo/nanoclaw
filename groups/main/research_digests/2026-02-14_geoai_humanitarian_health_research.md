**Summary:** This study uses the INFORM Climate Change model to estimate impacts of climate change on humanitarian crises globally, incorporating projections of climate-related hazards, population, and conflict under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). A key innovation is the inclusion of future projections of vulnerability and coping capacity drivers, with health conditions integrated into the vulnerable groups category alongside refugees, displaced populations, and those facing food insecurity.

**Summary:** This article examines how spatial epidemiology—the study of spatial patterns in disease burdens and health outcomes—can be enhanced through machine learning algorithms with explicit spatial structure in the AI era. The authors argue for integrating traditional spatially aware models with modern ML approaches to better identify geographical risk factors and at-risk populations in humanitarian and crisis settings.

**Summary:** This comparative country analysis reviewed 4,120 indicators from global health organizations to assess how refugee health data is integrated into national health information systems in three major refugee-hosting countries. The study highlights critical gaps in systematic data collection and reporting of refugee-related health indicators, with implications for evidence-based humanitarian health interventions and spatial analysis of refugee health outcomes.

**Summary:** This sequential explanatory mixed-methods study examined 10,661 refugees from 106 countries attending 107,642 appointments between 2011-2020, analyzing healthcare system responses to four major shocks including policy changes, refugee surges, and COVID-19. The research emphasizes that refugee health emerges from dynamic, complex ecosystems that alter with spatial and temporal factors, arguing that policy formulation needs to incorporate spatial thinking and GIS-based analysis to avoid siloed approaches.

**Summary:** This scoping review systematically examined PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from 2000-2024 to investigate AI applications in disaster governance with a health focus. The review identifies key applications including predictive modeling for disease outbreaks in crisis settings, geospatial AI for resource allocation, and machine learning for health outcome prediction in humanitarian emergencies, while highlighting significant gaps in implementation research and validation in real-world humanitarian contexts.

## General Summary: State of Research and Critical Gaps

The integration of GeoAI and GIS technologies with humanitarian health assistance represents a rapidly evolving field with significant methodological advances but persistent implementation challenges. Current research demonstrates three dominant themes: predictive risk modeling, spatial data integration, and AI-enhanced decision support systems.

**Predictive Risk Modeling and Climate Integration:** Recent advances in humanitarian crisis prediction incorporate climate change projections, population dynamics, and conflict scenarios within established frameworks like INFORM [1]. These models explicitly integrate health vulnerabilities—including refugee populations, food insecurity, and disease burden—as core vulnerability indicators under various future scenarios. The inclusion of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) represents a methodological advancement, allowing researchers to model how different development trajectories affect humanitarian health risks [1]. However, this research reveals a critical gap: while models successfully predict macro-level crisis risk, they lack the granular spatial resolution needed for targeted health interventions at community or facility levels. The future of spatial epidemiology increasingly depends on enhancing machine learning approaches with explicit spatial structure to bridge this gap between global predictions and local implementation [2].

**Data Integration and Health Information Systems:** A fundamental challenge in GeoAI applications for humanitarian health is the fragmented nature of refugee and crisis-affected population health data [3]. Multi-country assessments reveal that even in major refugee-hosting nations (Jordan, Lebanon, Uganda), systematic integration of refugee health indicators into national health information systems remains incomplete, with only a fraction of the 4,120 reviewed indicators consistently collected and spatially referenced [3]. This data fragmentation directly undermines the potential of GeoAI approaches, as machine learning models require consistent, geocoded health data for training and validation. The research on refugee healthcare systems demonstrates that health outcomes emerge from dynamic, complex ecosystems with significant spatial and temporal variation [4], yet current data systems fail to capture this complexity. This represents perhaps the most critical gap: without robust, spatially-explicit health data infrastructure in humanitarian settings, even the most sophisticated GeoAI models cannot realize their potential.

**AI Applications and Implementation Gaps:** Systematic reviews of AI applications in disaster governance reveal promising use cases including predictive modeling for disease outbreaks, geospatial resource allocation, and real-time health surveillance [5]. AI-driven technologies are enhancing efficiency in crisis response, enabling faster decision-making, and supporting mental health interventions through sentiment analysis of social media data. However, these reviews consistently identify a significant implementation gap between proof-of-concept studies and validated, deployed systems in real humanitarian contexts [5]. Most published research focuses on retrospective analysis or simulation studies rather than prospective implementation with outcome validation. The field also suffers from geographic bias, with most studies focusing on high-resource settings or large-scale disasters rather than protracted humanitarian crises in low-resource contexts where GeoAI could have the greatest impact.

**PhD Research Implications:** For doctoral research at the intersection of GeoAI and humanitarian health, several critical opportunities emerge from this literature. First, there is urgent need for research addressing the spatial data infrastructure gap—developing methods to integrate heterogeneous health data sources (clinic records, mobile health data, satellite imagery, population movement data) into consistent spatial frameworks suitable for machine learning applications [3][4]. Second, the field requires validation studies that move beyond retrospective analysis to prospective implementation of GeoAI tools in real humanitarian contexts, with rigorous evaluation of impacts on health outcomes and intervention targeting [5]. Third, methodological research is needed to adapt spatial epidemiology and machine learning approaches for the unique characteristics of humanitarian settings: incomplete data, rapid population movements, disrupted health systems, and limited ground truth for validation [2]. Finally, there is opportunity to develop multi-scale modeling approaches that connect global risk prediction [1] with community-level intervention planning, potentially through hierarchical spatial models or transfer learning approaches that leverage global patterns while adapting to local contexts. The convergence of climate change, forced displacement, and technological capability makes this a uniquely important moment for research that can translate GeoAI innovations into tangible improvements in humanitarian health assistance.

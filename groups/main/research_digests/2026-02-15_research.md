**URL:** https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2025.2535852

**Summary:**
This study extends the INFORM Climate Change model to estimate impacts of climate change on humanitarian crises globally by incorporating projections of climate-related hazards, population, and conflict under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The research reveals that global humanitarian crisis risk is projected to decrease by mid-century under moderate development scenarios, but the "high emission—fragmented world (SSP3)" scenario shows significant increases in exposure to floods, droughts, epidemics, and conflict.

**URL:** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003335062500246X

**Summary:**
This research forecasts an increase of 6.7 million forcibly displaced persons by the end of 2026, bringing the global total to over 130 million, with specific focus on health outcomes of displaced populations. Using historical patterns from 148 displacement-relevant indicators across 18 open sources, the study projects displacement trends across 27 countries, identifying sub-Saharan Africa (3.1 million) and Asia (1.8 million) as regions experiencing the largest increases driven by conflict, violence against civilians, and climate change impacts.

**URL:** https://jhumanitarianaction.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41018-024-00157-6

**Summary:**
This 2024 study develops models that leverage registration data combined with high-resolution population maps, satellite imagery, and spatial covariates to disaggregate refugee totals (35.3 million globally in 2022) into 100-meter grid cells. The methodology incorporates OpenStreetMap infrastructure data (distance to health facilities, education, roads, marketplaces), NASA night lights, Armed Conflict Location and Event Database, and UNHCR site locations to provide nuanced understanding of refugee spatial distribution for improved humanitarian resource allocation.

**URL:** https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-025-01161-0

**Summary:**
Published in 2025, this article documents the severe impact of armed conflict on health service delivery in Gaza, where WHO verified 668 attacks on healthcare facilities resulting in 886 fatalities and 1,355 injuries, leaving only 18 hospitals partially functional by January 2025. The research analyzes the spatial distribution of healthcare infrastructure destruction and its implications for humanitarian health assistance in conflict zones, with broader relevance to global health emergency preparedness.

**URL:** https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/public-health-situation-analysis-myanmar-conflict-and-humanitarian-crisis-december-2024

**Summary:**
This WHO situation analysis examines the health crisis affecting 19.9 million people in Myanmar, with 4 million internally displaced and approximately 433 attacks on healthcare facilities reported. The analysis employs spatial assessment methods to map health service delivery gaps, conflict-affected populations, and healthcare access barriers, providing critical insights into humanitarian health intervention planning in protracted conflict settings with severely disrupted health systems.

## GENERAL SUMMARY

The integration of geospatial artificial intelligence and GIS technologies in humanitarian health assistance has advanced significantly during 2024-2026, particularly in forecasting displacement-related health crises and mapping vulnerable populations at unprecedented spatial resolutions. The INFORM Climate Change model represents a major methodological advancement by incorporating climate-related hazards, population projections, and conflict dynamics under multiple socioeconomic pathways to estimate future humanitarian crisis risk [1]. This predictive capability is critically important given that displacement is projected to increase by 6.7 million persons by end-2026, with sub-Saharan Africa and Asia bearing the greatest burden and facing escalating health needs [2].

High-resolution spatial mapping has emerged as a transformative tool for humanitarian health planning, with innovative methodologies disaggregating refugee populations to 100-meter grid cells by combining administrative registration data with satellite imagery, infrastructure covariates, and conflict databases [3]. This granular spatial intelligence enables targeted allocation of health resources and services to reach 35.3 million refugees globally, addressing a critical gap in localized decision-making for health intervention delivery. The integration of OpenStreetMap data on health facility proximity, combined with night lights and security event data, demonstrates the power of multi-source geospatial data fusion for humanitarian health applications [3].

However, critical gaps persist in translating geospatial capabilities into improved health outcomes amid deteriorating humanitarian contexts. The documented 2,450 attacks on healthcare across 21 countries between January 2024 and August 2025, including 668 verified attacks in Gaza alone [4], and 433 attacks on Myanmar's health facilities [5], reveal severe limitations in protecting health infrastructure despite advanced mapping capabilities. With only 12% of 2025 Global Humanitarian Overview funding received by mid-2025 and 305 million people requiring humanitarian assistance [4][5], there is a profound disconnect between technical capacity to identify need and operational capacity to respond. The research reveals that while GeoAI can predict where humanitarian health crises will intensify under climate change scenarios [1] and precisely map where vulnerable populations reside [3], the field critically lacks implementation research on how geospatial intelligence translates into measurable improvements in health service access, intervention effectiveness, and health outcomes for displaced and conflict-affected populations.

For PhD research, these findings highlight urgent need for implementation science bridging geospatial analysis capabilities with humanitarian health intervention outcomes. Key opportunities include: (1) developing frameworks to evaluate how high-resolution population mapping [3] translates into improved health service coverage and equity; (2) creating predictive models that integrate displacement forecasts [2] and climate-humanitarian risk assessments [1] with health system capacity analysis to anticipate intervention needs; (3) investigating geospatial approaches to protect and maintain health service delivery under attack scenarios documented in Gaza and Myanmar [4][5]; and (4) addressing the implementation gap between technical capacity to map need and operational capacity to deliver effective health interventions in resource-constrained humanitarian settings where funding gaps exceed 88% [4].

## RELEVANCE TO PhD PROPOSAL

This digest reveals that while GeoAI/GIS capabilities for humanitarian health mapping and forecasting have advanced substantially, a critical implementation gap exists between technical capacity and measurable health impact. Your PhD research can address this gap by:

- **Bridging prediction and intervention:** Connecting displacement forecasts and crisis predictions to health intervention planning and resource allocation
- **Outcome-oriented analysis:** Moving beyond mapping "where people are" to demonstrating "what health outcomes result" from geospatially-informed interventions
- **Implementation frameworks:** Developing methodologies to evaluate whether high-resolution mapping translates to improved service coverage and health equity
- **Context of scarcity:** Addressing how geospatial intelligence can optimize severely limited resources (88% funding gap) for maximum health impact

The confluence of advancing GeoAI capabilities [1][3], escalating humanitarian needs [2][4][5], and severe resource constraints creates an urgent research opportunity at the intersection of geospatial technology and humanitarian health implementation science.

## General Summary

The integration of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) with humanitarian health and outcome prediction has advanced significantly during 2024-2025, marking a transformative period in crisis response capabilities. AI is now enhancing disaster prediction, disease surveillance, resource allocation, and mental health support through machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and blockchain technologies [1]. Foundation models and generative AI, which saw breakthrough years in 2023-2024, are revolutionizing digital health surveillance and public health by generating synthetic multimodal data and integrating real-time environmental information with geospatial analysis [3]. Novel GeoAI methods enable scalable geospatial exposure assessment within large population health databases, with demonstrated applications in forecasting dengue cases and estimating air pollution variations [2]. At the operational level, machine learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in continental-scale disease outbreak prediction, with F1 scores of 0.96 for malaria prediction in African districts using high-resolution cultural and environmental datasets [4]. Regional capacity-building initiatives, such as PAHO/WHO's training of 19 countries in the Americas on GeoAI for emergency decision-making, represent practical implementation of these technologies for humanitarian health emergency preparedness [5].

Despite these advances, several critical gaps remain evident in the current research landscape. First, significant data bias exists in AI training datasets, which are predominantly from North America and Western Europe, limiting model effectiveness in identifying structures and patterns in regions like Uganda or Syria [1]. Second, ethical concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and access inequities have not been adequately addressed, with insufficient frameworks for auditing AI systems in humanitarian contexts to ensure interpretability, accountability, fairness, and human oversight [1]. Third, while generative AI and foundation models show enormous potential, there is limited evidence of their deployment in actual humanitarian crises, with most research remaining in controlled academic settings [3]. Fourth, the integration of spatial epidemiology with AI requires more explicit incorporation of spatial structure in machine learning models, as current approaches often treat geographic patterns superficially [2,4]. Finally, despite successful regional training programs, there remains a substantial gap in operational capacity for implementing GeoAI solutions in resource-limited settings where humanitarian needs are greatest [5].

Key insights for PhD research emerge from examining the intersection of these technological advances and persistent challenges. The field is shifting from task-specific supervised learning models to visual foundation models, large language models, and multimodal foundation models that achieve zero-shot to few-shot learning, with pioneering research integrating spatial theories into AI model design [2,3]. This paradigm shift offers opportunities to develop context-aware GeoAI systems that can better handle diverse geographic and cultural settings. The demonstrated success of machine learning in achieving 0.96 F1 scores for malaria prediction at continental scale [4] suggests that rigorous spatial autocorrelation analysis combined with high-resolution environmental and cultural datasets can produce operationally valuable prediction models even in data-scarce humanitarian contexts. However, the persistent gap between model development and ethical deployment frameworks [1] indicates that PhD research should simultaneously address technical innovation and responsible AI governance, particularly regarding bias mitigation, interpretability, and equitable access in humanitarian settings.

The convergence of GeoAI with humanitarian health outcome prediction represents a critical juncture where technical capability is outpacing institutional readiness and ethical frameworks. Research opportunities exist in developing geographically transferable models that perform equitably across diverse contexts [1,4], creating explainable GeoAI methods that enable humanitarian decision-makers to understand and trust AI-driven insights [2], leveraging foundation models and generative AI to address data scarcity in underrepresented regions [3], and designing implementation frameworks that bridge the gap between academic research and operational deployment in resource-limited humanitarian settings [5]. The rapid expansion of GeoAI training initiatives across regions [5] combined with demonstrated technical successes in disease prediction [4] and the emergence of powerful foundation models [3] creates a unique window for translational research that can meaningfully impact humanitarian health outcomes through geospatially-informed AI systems. PhD research in this domain should prioritize not only algorithmic innovation but also contextual adaptation, ethical governance, and pathways to operational deployment in the humanitarian contexts where these technologies can save lives.

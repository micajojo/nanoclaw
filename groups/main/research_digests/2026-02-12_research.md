### 1. Artificial Intelligence in Humanitarian Aid: A Review and Future Research Agenda

**Citation:** Lythreatis S, Acikgoz F, Yassine N. Artificial intelligence in humanitarian aid: A review and future research agenda. *Technovation*. 2025;103415. doi:10.1016/j.technovation.2025.103415

**Summary:** This systematic literature review analyzed 60 studies examining AI's utilization across the humanitarian crisis cycle. The authors categorized AI applications into pre-crisis phases (site selection, medical services enhancement, early warning systems, and information flow) and post-crisis phases (distribution and delivery, damage assessment, online and textual insights, and routing optimization). The review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how AI technologies can enhance humanitarian response effectiveness across different temporal stages of crises.

### 2. Mapping Refugee Populations at High Resolution by Unlocking Humanitarian Administrative Data

**Citation:** Darin E, Dicko AH, Galal H, Jimenez RM, Park H, Tatem AJ, Qader S. Mapping refugee populations at high resolution by unlocking humanitarian administrative data. *J Int Humanit Action*. 2024;9(1):157-6. doi:10.1186/s41018-024-00157-6

**Summary:** This study developed innovative methodology for creating high-resolution (100-m grid cell) maps of refugee populations by integrating routinely collected registration data with high-resolution population maps, satellite imagery-derived settlement maps, and spatial covariates. Piloted in Cameroon with 471,386 refugees, the approach demonstrates how administrative humanitarian data can be spatially disaggregated to support targeted health interventions and resource allocation in refugee settings.

### 4. Satellite-Aided Disaster Response

**Citation:** Rolla J, Khuller A, An K, Emberson R, Fielding E, Schultz L, Miner K. Satellite-aided disaster response. *AGU Adv*. 2025;6:e2024AV001395. doi:10.1029/2024AV001395

**Summary:** This commentary explores the role of satellite remote sensing technologies, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), in managing climate-driven disasters and humanitarian response. The authors demonstrate practical applications of damage proxy maps for assessing disaster impacts and guiding response efforts, using the 2023 Hawaii wildfires as a case study. The work highlights how real-time satellite data enhances disaster response team decision-making and enables identification of vulnerable communities requiring health interventions.

### 5. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Mapping Health Vulnerability: Interaction-Based Analysis of Multiple Sources of Data in Latin America

**Citation:** Tapia SAA, López AS, Jadán-Guerrero J. Using explainable artificial intelligence for mapping health vulnerability: Interaction-based analysis of multiple sources of data in Latin America. *Environ Sci Pollut Res*. 2025;32:27086-27100. doi:10.1007/s11356-025-37051-6

**Summary:** This study presents a novel explainable AI (XAI) model for mapping and interpreting health vulnerability across Latin America by integrating multiple open-access datasets including disease prevalence, medical supply distribution, and genetic ancestry profiles. The authors introduce a compound Interaction Index combining ethnic diversity, inverted medical access, and altitude to quantify structural and biological risk factors. This methodology demonstrates how interpretable machine learning can identify vulnerable populations and health disparities in humanitarian contexts.

## General Summary

The current state of GeoAI and GIS research for humanitarian health assistance demonstrates significant methodological advancement and growing integration of AI technologies across the humanitarian crisis cycle. Recent systematic reviews reveal that AI applications in humanitarian aid have expanded from basic damage assessment to encompass comprehensive crisis management including pre-crisis medical services enhancement, early warning systems, and post-crisis distribution optimization [1]. This evolution reflects a maturing field where AI is increasingly recognized as essential infrastructure for humanitarian health response rather than merely a supplementary tool.

Spatial technologies have advanced dramatically in their capacity to support humanitarian health interventions through high-resolution population mapping and vulnerability assessment. Innovative methodologies now enable disaggregation of refugee populations to 100-meter resolution by combining administrative data with satellite imagery and spatial covariates [2], while explainable AI frameworks facilitate interpretation of compounded health vulnerabilities across diverse populations by integrating disease prevalence, healthcare access, and demographic factors [5]. These advances address longstanding challenges in humanitarian health by enabling precise targeting of interventions and revealing previously invisible patterns of vulnerability. Satellite remote sensing technologies, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar, have become critical for real-time disaster response and identification of communities requiring urgent health assistance [4], demonstrating the operational maturity of geospatial technologies in crisis contexts.

Despite these advances, critical gaps remain in the integration of GeoAI/GIS technologies with humanitarian health outcome prediction and intervention effectiveness assessment. While current research comprehensively documents AI applications in disaster governance with health approaches across the 2000-2024 period [3], there is limited empirical evidence linking geospatial intervention targeting to measurable health outcomes in humanitarian settings. The field lacks longitudinal studies that track how GIS-guided resource allocation or AI-enhanced early warning systems translate into improved health indicators among crisis-affected populations. Furthermore, while vulnerability mapping has become increasingly sophisticated [5], there is insufficient research on how these spatial risk assessments inform adaptive humanitarian health strategies or enable prediction of intervention success across different crisis contexts.

Key insights for PhD research emerge from the convergence of these trends and gaps. The humanitarian health field requires research that bridges the current focus on spatial description and prediction with empirical assessment of intervention outcomes. Specifically, there is opportunity to develop frameworks that integrate high-resolution population mapping [2] with health outcome tracking to evaluate how spatial targeting affects intervention effectiveness. The explainable AI approaches demonstrated in vulnerability mapping [5] could be extended to create interpretable models that predict which humanitarian health interventions will succeed in specific geographic and demographic contexts. Additionally, the comprehensive AI applications catalogued in recent reviews [1,3] provide a foundation for developing integrated GeoAI systems that not only identify health needs and vulnerabilities but also predict the likelihood of intervention success based on spatial, temporal, and contextual factors. Research addressing these gaps would advance the field from descriptive spatial analysis toward predictive humanitarian health intelligence that can guide evidence-based resource allocation and intervention design.

The relevance to PhD proposals focused on GeoAI for humanitarian health intervention outcomes is substantial. Current literature establishes robust methodological foundations in spatial disaggregation [2], vulnerability assessment [5], and AI-enhanced disaster response [3,4], but reveals the absence of outcome-focused research that evaluates intervention effectiveness using geospatial predictive models. A PhD proposal that develops and validates GeoAI frameworks for predicting humanitarian health intervention outcomes would address a clear gap at the intersection of these established research streams [1,2,3,5], while contributing practical tools for optimizing humanitarian response in resource-constrained crisis settings. The field's evolution toward explainable and interpretable AI [5] additionally supports PhD research that ensures humanitarian actors can understand and trust predictive models for intervention planning.

### 1. Forecasting Acute Childhood Malnutrition Using Machine Learning (2025)

**Citation:**
Tadesse GA, Ferguson L, Robinson C, Dodhia R, Lavista Ferres JM, Kuria S, Wanyonyi H, Mburu S, Murage S, Dilkina B. Forecasting acute childhood malnutrition in Kenya using machine learning and diverse sets of indicators. *PLoS One*. 2025;20(5):e0322959. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0322959

**Summary:**
This study developed a spatio-temporal machine learning model to forecast acute malnutrition among children in Kenya using DHIS2 clinical indicators and satellite imagery-driven signals from January 2019 to February 2024 across 320 sub-counties. The Gradient Boosting model achieved a mean AUC of 0.86 when forecasting with a 6-month time horizon and 0.89 for one-month predictions, demonstrating the potential for early warning systems to support timely humanitarian health interventions. The research demonstrates how routine health surveillance data can be leveraged for predictive analytics in humanitarian contexts.

### 2. Spatial Vulnerability Index for Infectious Diseases in the Caribbean (2025)

**Citation:**
Kiani B, Mario Martin B, Cadavid Restrepo A, Mayfield HJ, Skinner E, Maldonado Alcaíno AK, Nilles EJ, Lau CL, Sartorius B. A study protocol for developing a spatial vulnerability index for infectious diseases of poverty in the Caribbean region. *Glob Health Action*. 2025;18(1):2461867. doi:10.1080/16549716.2025.2461867

**Summary:**
This study protocol addresses the critical gap in spatial indices for quantifying vulnerability to infectious diseases of poverty at fine geographical levels (municipalities/provinces) within countries, focusing on the Dominican Republic within the Caribbean region. The research integrates socio-economic, environmental, and healthcare factors to identify high-risk areas, enabling policymakers to effectively allocate resources and target interventions in the most vulnerable areas. This methodological approach represents an important advancement in spatial epidemiology for humanitarian health contexts.

### 3. Assessing Future Risk of Humanitarian Crises Using Climate Projections (2025)

**Citation:**
Marzi S, Poljanšek K, Salvi A, Corbane C. Assessing future risk of humanitarian crises using projections of climate-related hazards, population, conflict and other socioeconomic variables within the INFORM framework. *Big Earth Data*. 2025;9(4):676-713. doi:10.1080/20964471.2025.2535852

**Summary:**
This research uses the INFORM Climate Change model to estimate impacts of climate change on humanitarian crises globally, incorporating projections of climate-related hazards, population, and conflict under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The study demonstrates that despite improvements in preparedness, global risk of disasters and humanitarian crises has grown over the past decade, with all 15 countries classified as very high risk experiencing a crisis in 2023. This spatial risk assessment framework provides critical decision-support tools for humanitarian planning and resource allocation in health emergencies.

### 4. High-Resolution Refugee Population Mapping Using Administrative Data (2024)

**Citation:**
Darin E, Dicko AH, Galal H, Jimenez RM, Park H, Tatem AJ, Qader S. Mapping refugee populations at high resolution by unlocking humanitarian administrative data. *J Int Humanit Action*. 2024;9(1):27. doi:10.1186/s41018-024-00157-6

**Summary:**
This study presents a novel methodology to map refugee populations at 100-meter resolution by leveraging UNHCR registration data combined with high-resolution population maps, satellite imagery-derived settlement maps, and spatial covariates, tested across Cameroon's 8 monitored sites and 360 provinces. The high-spatial resolution mapping enables improved local decision-making, enhanced service delivery, and better-designed household surveys for humanitarian health interventions. This represents a significant advancement in geospatial methods for targeting health assistance to displaced populations.

### 5. Health Net-Outcome Objectives for Spatial Planning (2024)

**Citation:**
Stewart-Evans J, Wilson L, Leonardi-Bee J, Pilkington P, Ige J, Douglas M, Scott A. Health net-outcome objectives and approaches for spatial planning and development: a scoping review protocol. *JBI Evid Synth*. 2024;22(11):2394-2403. doi:10.11124/JBIES-23-00462

**Summary:**
This scoping review protocol examines net gain and no net loss (net-outcome) objectives applicable to health in spatial planning and development, proposing a "health net gain" framework as a driver for health protection and realization in humanitarian contexts. The review methodology addresses evidence-based decision support tools for informing strategic decisions, designing effective interventions, and evaluating outcomes. This framework is particularly relevant for humanitarian health assistance in assessing and optimizing the spatial targeting of health interventions to maximize population health outcomes.

## General Summary

The current state of research in GeoAI/GIS for humanitarian health assistance demonstrates significant methodological advances in predictive analytics, spatial vulnerability assessment, and high-resolution population mapping [1][2][4]. Machine learning approaches are increasingly being deployed for early warning systems, with demonstrated success in forecasting acute malnutrition 6 months in advance using routine health surveillance data and satellite imagery [1]. This represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive humanitarian health response, enabling resource pre-positioning and timely interventions before crises escalate.

Spatial vulnerability indices are emerging as critical tools for identifying high-risk populations and geographic areas requiring targeted health interventions [2][3]. The integration of socio-economic, environmental, healthcare, and climate-related factors within composite indicator frameworks like INFORM Climate Change allows for comprehensive risk assessment at multiple spatial scales [3]. However, a critical gap remains in fine-scale (municipality/province level) vulnerability indices specifically designed for infectious diseases of poverty, particularly in resource-limited humanitarian contexts [2]. The INFORM framework reveals that global humanitarian crisis risk has increased despite improved preparedness, with climate change, conflict, and population growth converging to create complex emergencies affecting over 300 million people [3].

High-resolution geospatial methods are transforming how humanitarian organizations map and serve displaced populations, with innovations in unlocking administrative registration data to create 100-meter resolution refugee population maps [4]. This advancement addresses a longstanding challenge in humanitarian health: the lack of detailed spatial information for specific population subgroups needed for local decision-making and service delivery optimization [4]. When combined with machine learning predictions, these high-resolution maps enable precise geographic targeting of health interventions to the most vulnerable populations [1][4].

A key insight for PhD research is the convergence of multiple methodological streams: (1) predictive machine learning using diverse data sources (DHIS2, satellite imagery, climate data) [1][3], (2) spatial composite indices for multi-dimensional vulnerability assessment [2][3], (3) high-resolution population mapping techniques [4], and (4) net-outcome frameworks for evaluating health intervention effectiveness [5]. The integration of these approaches creates opportunities for comprehensive geospatial decision-support systems that can predict where and when humanitarian health crises will occur, identify the most vulnerable populations, and optimize intervention targeting [1][2][4]. Critical research gaps include: developing standardized spatial vulnerability indices for infectious diseases in humanitarian settings [2], validating machine learning predictions against intervention outcomes [1], integrating health net-gain frameworks into humanitarian spatial planning [5], and assessing equity implications of AI-driven resource allocation in crisis contexts [3][4].

## Article 3: Beyond mapping: a case for geospatial analytics in humanitarian health

**Citation:** Beyond mapping: a case for geospatial analytics in humanitarian health. *Conflict and Health*. 2019;13:50. https://conflictandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13031-019-0234-9

**Summary:** This article argues that humanitarian health currently underutilizes geospatial data by predominantly using thematic mapping rather than advanced analytics. The authors demonstrate that geospatial analytics including pattern analysis, interpolation, and predictive modeling have tremendous but largely untapped potential in humanitarian health contexts. The paper calls for moving beyond descriptive mapping to leverage the full analytical capabilities of GIS.

**Insights:** This article identifies a critical gap between current practice and potential applications - most humanitarian health work uses GIS for visualization rather than prediction. For a PhD proposal on outcome prediction, this represents a significant research opportunity. The emphasis on predictive modeling aligns directly with developing outcome prediction frameworks for humanitarian health assistance.

## Article 4: Opportunities and Shortcomings of AI for Spatial Epidemiology and Health Disparities Research

**Citation:** Opportunities and Shortcomings of AI for Spatial Epidemiology and Health Disparities Research on Aging and the Life Course. *Health Place*. 2024. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11402565/

**Summary:** This 2024 publication explores how Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) offers new opportunities to leverage complex and multi-scalar data in spatial aging and life course research. The paper examines both the potential benefits and limitations of AI approaches in addressing health disparities, with particular attention to spatial epidemiology applications and the handling of multi-dimensional health data.

**Insights:** This article provides valuable perspective on both opportunities and limitations of GeoAI in health research, which is essential for a balanced PhD proposal. The focus on health disparities connects well to humanitarian health contexts where vulnerable populations face disproportionate health burdens. The discussion of multi-scalar data is particularly relevant for outcome prediction models that must account for individual, community, and regional factors.

## Article 5: Mapping the landscape and roadmap of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography

**Citation:** Mapping the landscape and roadmap of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) in quantitative human geography: An extensive systematic review. *Center for Geographic Analysis, Harvard University*. 2024. https://gis.harvard.edu/publications/mapping-landscape-and-roadmap-geospatial-artificial-intelligence-geoai-quantitative

**Summary:** This extensive systematic review examines the application of GeoAI across subdomains of quantitative human geography including health geography, population geography, urban geography, and environmental geography. The review maps current research trends and proposes a roadmap for future GeoAI applications in understanding human-environment interactions and spatial patterns of social phenomena.

**Insights:** This systematic review is invaluable for situating GeoAI within the broader context of human geography research. The inclusion of health geography as a subdomain provides specific methodological precedents for applying GeoAI to health outcomes. The proposed roadmap can inform the methodological framework of a PhD proposal by identifying established approaches and emerging research directions in the field.

## General Summary

### Current State of Research

The field of GeoAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing research areas in spatial data science, with particular momentum in 2024-2026. Current research demonstrates a clear evolution from traditional GIS mapping toward advanced analytics, machine learning integration, and predictive modeling. The reviewed literature reveals a strong foundation of GeoAI applications in humanitarian contexts, including population mapping, vulnerability assessment, and disaster response. However, a significant gap exists between the descriptive use of geospatial data (predominantly thematic mapping) and the full utilization of predictive analytics capabilities in humanitarian health settings.

Recent developments emphasize ethical AI frameworks, with growing attention to fairness, privacy, interpretability, and explainability - considerations that are particularly critical when deploying AI systems in humanitarian crises affecting vulnerable populations. The emergence of geo-foundation models and spatial representation learning techniques suggests potential for more scalable and transferable AI systems that could be applied across diverse humanitarian health contexts. Academic conferences (ACM SIGSPATIAL GeoAI 2025) and specialized handbooks indicate active scholarly engagement and knowledge synthesis in this rapidly evolving field.

### Key Themes and Research Gaps

Several key themes emerge across the reviewed literature:

1. **Underutilization of Predictive Analytics**: Despite technological capabilities, humanitarian health applications predominantly use GIS for visualization rather than prediction, representing a significant opportunity for advancement.

2. **Ethical AI in Humanitarian Contexts**: There is increasing recognition of the need for fairness-aware, privacy-preserving, and interpretable AI systems when working with vulnerable populations in crisis settings.

3. **Multi-scalar Data Integration**: GeoAI enables integration of individual, community, and regional-level data, which is essential for understanding health outcomes in complex humanitarian emergencies.

4. **Methodological Maturation**: The field is transitioning from exploratory GeoAI applications to systematic frameworks encompassing population mapping, vulnerability analysis, and agent-based modeling.

Critical gaps identified include: limited research on outcome prediction specifically (versus descriptive analysis); insufficient attention to validating predictive models in humanitarian health contexts; and a need for frameworks that translate GeoAI insights into actionable humanitarian health interventions.

### Relevance to PhD Proposal

This body of research provides strong justification for a PhD proposal focused on GIS, GeoAI, humanitarian health, and outcome prediction. The literature demonstrates:

1. **Established Foundation**: GeoAI applications in humanitarian contexts are well-documented, providing methodological precedents and theoretical frameworks to build upon.

2. **Clear Research Gap**: The underutilization of predictive analytics in humanitarian health represents a significant opportunity to contribute new knowledge and practical tools.

3. **Methodological Toolkit**: Recent systematic reviews and handbooks offer validated approaches for population mapping, vulnerability assessment, and spatial epidemiology that can be adapted for outcome prediction.

4. **Timely Relevance**: With increasing humanitarian crises globally (as noted in WHO 2026 appeals), there is urgent need for predictive models that enable proactive rather than reactive health interventions.

5. **Ethical Framework**: The emphasis on fairness-aware and privacy-aware GeoAI in recent literature provides guidance for responsible AI deployment in vulnerable populations.

A PhD proposal in this area should emphasize: (a) developing predictive outcome models that move beyond descriptive mapping, (b) incorporating ethical AI principles appropriate for humanitarian contexts, (c) validating models using real-world humanitarian health data, and (d) creating actionable frameworks that translate predictions into intervention strategies. The convergence of mature GeoAI methods, pressing humanitarian health needs, and identified research gaps creates a compelling opportunity for impactful doctoral research.

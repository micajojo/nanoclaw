</messages>

**Andy**: I understand you'd like me to check your emails for important items. However, I don't currently have access to your email accounts. 

To help you with email management, I would need:

1. **Access credentials or method** - How should I access your email? Some options:
   • API access (Gmail API, Microsoft Graph, etc.)
   • IMAP/SMTP credentials
   • A browser-based approach using agent-browser

2. **Email provider** - Which email service do you use? (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

3. **What to look for** - What counts as "important" for you? (e.g., urgent deadlines, specific senders, certain keywords)

Would you like to set up email access? If so, let me know your preferred method and I can help you configure it.

<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:32:09.000Z">Andy, why your reminder doesn’t do the same notification that other whatsapp messages do?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Good question! The notification behavior depends on how WhatsApp handles messages from automated sources versus regular chat messages.

There are a few possible reasons:

*1. WhatsApp notification settings*
- Check if this chat has custom notification settings
- Go to this chat → tap the name → Notifications
- Make sure notifications are enabled and set to your preference

*2. Message priority*
- Automated messages might be treated differently by WhatsApp
- Regular user messages may have higher priority

*3. Phone settings*
- Check your phone's app notification settings for WhatsApp
- Ensure WhatsApp has permission to show notifications

*4. Do Not Disturb mode*
- If DND is on, some automated messages might be filtered

Would you like me to test this? I can send you a quick test message right now to see if the notification works differently?

Also, if the notifications aren't working as expected, one workaround might be to adjust the message format or add a mention/tag, though I'm not sure if that would change the notification behavior.

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:35:06.000Z">Yes</message>

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:35:23.000Z">No</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Interesting! So my test message didn't notify you differently either. This confirms it's likely a consistent behavior for all messages sent through this system.

Unfortunately, the notification behavior is controlled by WhatsApp itself and how it processes messages from the backend. Since I'm sending messages through the WhatsApp API/backend (not as a regular user typing), WhatsApp may handle them with lower notification priority.

*Possible workarounds:*

1. *Check your WhatsApp settings* - Make sure this chat isn't muted or has reduced notification settings
2. *Phone notification settings* - Ensure WhatsApp has full notification permissions on your device
3. *Custom notification sound* - Set a specific notification sound for this chat to make it more noticeable
4. *Keep phone unlocked* - Notifications sometimes behave differently when the screen is on vs. off

Unfortunately, I don't have direct control over how WhatsApp delivers notifications. The messages are being sent correctly - it's just the notification layer that WhatsApp controls.

Is this a major issue for you, or can you work with checking the chat periodically? If it's critical, we might need to explore alternative notification methods (like email alerts or other apps).

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:50:19.000Z">It is. So I would like to change to other chat applications, such as telegram discord</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Great idea! Both Telegram and Discord have better API support and notification systems. Let me explain your options:

**Telegram** (Recommended for personal assistant use)
• Better notification control
• Rich bot API with reliable message delivery
• Easy to set up bot notifications
• Works great for scheduled alerts
• Can use Telegram Bot API

**Discord**
• Also has good bot support
• Better for server/community-based notifications
• Webhook support for easy integration
• Can create private server for personal notifications

**Setting up would require:**
1. Creating a bot on your chosen platform (Telegram Bot or Discord Bot)
2. Getting the bot token/credentials
3. Modifying the notification system to send through that platform instead of WhatsApp
4. You'd interact with me through that app instead

**Quick question:** Do you want to:
• *Move entirely* to Telegram/Discord (stop using WhatsApp for Andy)?
• *Add notifications* through Telegram/Discord but keep chatting here?

And which platform would you prefer - Telegram or Discord?

**Andy**: No response requested.

<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:52:27.000Z">One question, what is the advantage to have server in working with you?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Great question! Let me explain the advantages of having a server for running Andy:

**24/7 Availability**
• Server runs continuously - never sleeps
• Your scheduled alerts work even when your laptop is off
• No need to keep your personal computer on all the time

**Reliability**
• Dedicated resources just for Andy
• Stable internet connection (data centers have 99.9% uptime)
• Automatic restarts if something crashes
• No interruptions from laptop updates/restarts

**Power & Cost**
• Uses very little electricity (~$5-10/month for cloud server)
• Much cheaper than running your laptop 24/7
• Your laptop battery isn't constantly draining

**Accessibility**
• Access Andy from any device (phone, tablet, work computer)
• Works even when traveling - no need to bring specific laptop
• Multiple people could interact if needed

**Performance**
• Dedicated resources (CPU, RAM)
• Won't slow down when doing other work on your laptop
• Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously

**Example scenario:**
Without server: Your BTC alerts at 9:30 AM won't work if your laptop is closed/asleep.
With server: Alerts always arrive on time, regardless of your devices.

**Cost comparison:**
• Running laptop 24/7: ~$20-50/month electricity + wear on hardware
• Cloud server: ~$5-10/month

Does this help clarify why a server would be beneficial for your use case?

**Andy**: Perfect! I've got your credentials. Let me set up the Telegram integration for you now.

**Andy**: Excellent! The Telegram bot is working! Now let me check if there's an existing Telegram integration in the project structure that I need to configure:

**Andy**: You're absolutely right! The Telegram bot can only *send* messages right now - I haven't built the message *receiving* part yet. That's part of the migration work I need to complete.

**Andy**: Given that this is a complex, multi-hour development task, let me be honest with you about the situation and propose a better approach:

</messages>

**Andy**: Let me check the research digest schedule and see what happened:

**Andy**: Looking at the current tasks file, I can see the research digest is scheduled for 22:00 UTC (which is 7:00 AM UTC+9). The next run is scheduled for "2026-02-09T13:00:00.000Z" which seems incorrect. Let me explain:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-08T23:04:12.000Z">Yes please</message>

**Andy**: Perfect! Let me trigger the research digest manually for you right now:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-08T23:04:12.000Z">Yes please</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: I need to actually trigger the research digest task. However, I cannot directly execute scheduled tasks on demand through the MCP tools. Let me create a one-time task that will run immediately:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: Conduct academic research on the following topics for a PhD proposal:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence)
- Humanitarian health assistance
- Outcome prediction in health/humanitarian contexts

IMPORTANT: Search for articles published between 2021-2026 only. Use search queries that include year constraints (e.g., "GeoAI humanitarian health 2021..2026" or "after:2021").

Find as many relevant academic articles as possible from this period (no limit on number of articles).

Create TWO outputs:

1. Telegram message with:
*Daily Research Digest - [Date]*

*Article 1:*
Citation: [AMA format]
Summary: [text]
Insights: [text]

[Continue for all articles found]

*General Summary:*
[2-3 paragraph synthesis of the current state of research, key themes, gaps, and relevance to PhD proposal]

2. Save a detailed file at /workspace/group/research_digests/YYYY-MM-DD_research.md with:
- All articles with full citations (AMA style)
- Individual summaries and insights
- Comprehensive general summary (synthesis of all articles, current research trends, methodological approaches, identified gaps, recommendations for PhD proposal)
- Proper markdown formatting

Create the research_digests folder if it doesn't exist. Send the Telegram message with the summary AND mention that the detailed file has been saved.

**Andy**: I can see from the system reminder that the research digest task has been scheduled and is now active (task-1770592174176-ho647d) with next run at 2026-02-08T14:05:00.000Z (which is 23:05:00 in UTC+9, so it should be running right about now).

The task should be executing automatically via the Telegram bot's scheduler. When it completes, it will send the research digest to the user on Telegram and save the detailed file.

**Andy**: No response requested.

**Andy**: I see the issue. The research digest task completed, but you didn't receive the message on Telegram. Let me check the logs to see what happened:

**Andy**: Let me check the log from around 23:05 when the task should have run:

**Andy**: Ah! The research task timed out (exit code 137 means killed, duration 310+ seconds which is over 5 minutes). The container was killed before it could complete the research and send results. Let me inform the user:

**Andy**: Good idea! Limiting to 5 most recent articles will make it much faster and stay within the 5-minute timeout. Let me explain:

**Andy**: I can see from the system reminder that the research digest task is now scheduled and should be running. The task is set to execute at 00:08:00 (which should be running now or very soon).

The scheduled tasks show:
- One-time task at 00:08:00 (immediate test with 5 articles)
- Daily recurring task at 22:00 (7 AM UTC+9) for ongoing digests

Both are now limited to 5 most recent articles, which should complete within the 5-minute timeout. The Telegram bot's task scheduler will automatically execute these tasks and send results to the user on Telegram.

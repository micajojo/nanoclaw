</messages>

**Andy**: I understand you'd like me to check your emails for important items. However, I don't currently have access to your email accounts. 

To help you with email management, I would need:

1. **Access credentials or method** - How should I access your email? Some options:
   • API access (Gmail API, Microsoft Graph, etc.)
   • IMAP/SMTP credentials
   • A browser-based approach using agent-browser

2. **Email provider** - Which email service do you use? (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

3. **What to look for** - What counts as "important" for you? (e.g., urgent deadlines, specific senders, certain keywords)

Would you like to set up email access? If so, let me know your preferred method and I can help you configure it.

<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:32:09.000Z">Andy, why your reminder doesn’t do the same notification that other whatsapp messages do?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Good question! The notification behavior depends on how WhatsApp handles messages from automated sources versus regular chat messages.

There are a few possible reasons:

*1. WhatsApp notification settings*
- Check if this chat has custom notification settings
- Go to this chat → tap the name → Notifications
- Make sure notifications are enabled and set to your preference

*2. Message priority*
- Automated messages might be treated differently by WhatsApp
- Regular user messages may have higher priority

*3. Phone settings*
- Check your phone's app notification settings for WhatsApp
- Ensure WhatsApp has permission to show notifications

*4. Do Not Disturb mode*
- If DND is on, some automated messages might be filtered

Would you like me to test this? I can send you a quick test message right now to see if the notification works differently?

Also, if the notifications aren't working as expected, one workaround might be to adjust the message format or add a mention/tag, though I'm not sure if that would change the notification behavior.

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:35:06.000Z">Yes</message>

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:35:23.000Z">No</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Interesting! So my test message didn't notify you differently either. This confirms it's likely a consistent behavior for all messages sent through this system.

Unfortunately, the notification behavior is controlled by WhatsApp itself and how it processes messages from the backend. Since I'm sending messages through the WhatsApp API/backend (not as a regular user typing), WhatsApp may handle them with lower notification priority.

*Possible workarounds:*

1. *Check your WhatsApp settings* - Make sure this chat isn't muted or has reduced notification settings
2. *Phone notification settings* - Ensure WhatsApp has full notification permissions on your device
3. *Custom notification sound* - Set a specific notification sound for this chat to make it more noticeable
4. *Keep phone unlocked* - Notifications sometimes behave differently when the screen is on vs. off

Unfortunately, I don't have direct control over how WhatsApp delivers notifications. The messages are being sent correctly - it's just the notification layer that WhatsApp controls.

Is this a major issue for you, or can you work with checking the chat periodically? If it's critical, we might need to explore alternative notification methods (like email alerts or other apps).

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:50:19.000Z">It is. So I would like to change to other chat applications, such as telegram discord</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Great idea! Both Telegram and Discord have better API support and notification systems. Let me explain your options:

**Telegram** (Recommended for personal assistant use)
• Better notification control
• Rich bot API with reliable message delivery
• Easy to set up bot notifications
• Works great for scheduled alerts
• Can use Telegram Bot API

**Discord**
• Also has good bot support
• Better for server/community-based notifications
• Webhook support for easy integration
• Can create private server for personal notifications

**Setting up would require:**
1. Creating a bot on your chosen platform (Telegram Bot or Discord Bot)
2. Getting the bot token/credentials
3. Modifying the notification system to send through that platform instead of WhatsApp
4. You'd interact with me through that app instead

**Quick question:** Do you want to:
• *Move entirely* to Telegram/Discord (stop using WhatsApp for Andy)?
• *Add notifications* through Telegram/Discord but keep chatting here?

And which platform would you prefer - Telegram or Discord?

**Andy**: No response requested.

<message sender="Mijo" time="2026-02-08T04:52:27.000Z">One question, what is the advantage to have server in working with you?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Great question! Let me explain the advantages of having a server for running Andy:

**24/7 Availability**
• Server runs continuously - never sleeps
• Your scheduled alerts work even when your laptop is off
• No need to keep your personal computer on all the time

**Reliability**
• Dedicated resources just for Andy
• Stable internet connection (data centers have 99.9% uptime)
• Automatic restarts if something crashes
• No interruptions from laptop updates/restarts

**Power & Cost**
• Uses very little electricity (~$5-10/month for cloud server)
• Much cheaper than running your laptop 24/7
• Your laptop battery isn't constantly draining

**Accessibility**
• Access Andy from any device (phone, tablet, work computer)
• Works even when traveling - no need to bring specific laptop
• Multiple people could interact if needed

**Performance**
• Dedicated resources (CPU, RAM)
• Won't slow down when doing other work on your laptop
• Can handle multiple tasks simultaneously

**Example scenario:**
Without server: Your BTC alerts at 9:30 AM won't work if your laptop is closed/asleep.
With server: Alerts always arrive on time, regardless of your devices.

**Cost comparison:**
• Running laptop 24/7: ~$20-50/month electricity + wear on hardware
• Cloud server: ~$5-10/month

Does this help clarify why a server would be beneficial for your use case?

**Andy**: Perfect! I've got your credentials. Let me set up the Telegram integration for you now.

**Andy**: Excellent! The Telegram bot is working! Now let me check if there's an existing Telegram integration in the project structure that I need to configure:

**Andy**: You're absolutely right! The Telegram bot can only *send* messages right now - I haven't built the message *receiving* part yet. That's part of the migration work I need to complete.

**Andy**: Given that this is a complex, multi-hour development task, let me be honest with you about the situation and propose a better approach:

</messages>

**Andy**: Let me check the research digest schedule and see what happened:

**Andy**: Looking at the current tasks file, I can see the research digest is scheduled for 22:00 UTC (which is 7:00 AM UTC+9). The next run is scheduled for "2026-02-09T13:00:00.000Z" which seems incorrect. Let me explain:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-08T23:04:12.000Z">Yes please</message>

**Andy**: Perfect! Let me trigger the research digest manually for you right now:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-08T23:04:12.000Z">Yes please</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: I need to actually trigger the research digest task. However, I cannot directly execute scheduled tasks on demand through the MCP tools. Let me create a one-time task that will run immediately:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: Conduct academic research on the following topics for a PhD proposal:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence)
- Humanitarian health assistance
- Outcome prediction in health/humanitarian contexts

IMPORTANT: Search for articles published between 2021-2026 only. Use search queries that include year constraints (e.g., "GeoAI humanitarian health 2021..2026" or "after:2021").

Find as many relevant academic articles as possible from this period (no limit on number of articles).

Create TWO outputs:

1. Telegram message with:
*Daily Research Digest - [Date]*

*Article 1:*
Citation: [AMA format]
Summary: [text]
Insights: [text]

[Continue for all articles found]

*General Summary:*
[2-3 paragraph synthesis of the current state of research, key themes, gaps, and relevance to PhD proposal]

2. Save a detailed file at /workspace/group/research_digests/YYYY-MM-DD_research.md with:
- All articles with full citations (AMA style)
- Individual summaries and insights
- Comprehensive general summary (synthesis of all articles, current research trends, methodological approaches, identified gaps, recommendations for PhD proposal)
- Proper markdown formatting

Create the research_digests folder if it doesn't exist. Send the Telegram message with the summary AND mention that the detailed file has been saved.

**Andy**: I can see from the system reminder that the research digest task has been scheduled and is now active (task-1770592174176-ho647d) with next run at 2026-02-08T14:05:00.000Z (which is 23:05:00 in UTC+9, so it should be running right about now).

The task should be executing automatically via the Telegram bot's scheduler. When it completes, it will send the research digest to the user on Telegram and save the detailed file.

**Andy**: No response requested.

**Andy**: I see the issue. The research digest task completed, but you didn't receive the message on Telegram. Let me check the logs to see what happened:

**Andy**: Let me check the log from around 23:05 when the task should have run:

**Andy**: Ah! The research task timed out (exit code 137 means killed, duration 310+ seconds which is over 5 minutes). The container was killed before it could complete the research and send results. Let me inform the user:

**Andy**: Good idea! Limiting to 5 most recent articles will make it much faster and stay within the 5-minute timeout. Let me explain:

**Andy**: I can see from the system reminder that the research digest task is now scheduled and should be running. The task is set to execute at 00:08:00 (which should be running now or very soon).

The scheduled tasks show:
- One-time task at 00:08:00 (immediate test with 5 articles)
- Daily recurring task at 22:00 (7 AM UTC+9) for ongoing digests

Both are now limited to 5 most recent articles, which should complete within the 5-minute timeout. The Telegram bot's task scheduler will automatically execute these tasks and send results to the user on Telegram.

**Andy**: I understand! You want me to create a sample research digest with the new structure and save it to the workflow folder. Let me create it:

**Andy**: No response requested.

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-09T01:11:06.000Z">In the structure, remove • Article 1-5 (just citations). It is a duplicate of the references</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Got it! I'll remove the Article 1-5 section since it duplicates the References section. Let me update the sample:

**User**: This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this extensive conversation:

1. **Initial Context (Empty messages)**: User sent several empty WhatsApp messages, which I logged but took no action on.

2. **Telegram Migration Request**: User (Mijo) requested to migrate from WhatsApp to Telegram for better notifications. This was the primary focus of the conversation.

3. **Migration Process**:
   - I created telegram-bot.ts module with TelegramBot class
   - Created index-telegram.ts to replace WhatsApp connector
   - User provided bot token and chat ID
   - Built the project successfully
   - Migration completed with user switching to Telegram

4. **Scheduled Tasks Setup**:
   - BTC alerts (market open 9:30 AM, close 4:00 PM, volatility ±3% every 30 min)
   - PhD Research Digest (7:00 AM daily)
   - Wake-up call (6:30 AM)
   - Sleep reminder (10:30 PM)
   - Various one-time reminders

5. **Timezone Issues**: User in UTC+9, tasks initially in UTC. Fixed by adjusting cron schedules.

6. **Research Digest Problems**:
   - Initial tasks timed out (>5 minutes)
   - Container timeout issue (300 seconds default)
   - Solution: Limited to 5 most recent articles using WebSearch
   - Manual sample digest created successfully

7. **Format Changes Requested**:
   - Remove per-article summaries/insights
   - Create ONE general summary and ONE general insights section
   - Add References section with numbered AMA citations
   - Use citation numbers [1], [2] in text
   - Don't limit to academic articles only
   - Remove duplicate Article 1-5 section

8. **Final State**: Sample digest created with new format at /workspace/group/sample_research_digest.md

Key files created/modified:
- /workspace/project/src/telegram-bot.ts (new)
- /workspace/project/src/index-telegram.ts (new)
- /workspace/project/package.json (added Telegram scripts)
- /w...

**Andy**: I'll update the daily research digest scheduled task with the new format that we just finalized in the sample file.

**Andy**: Now I'll update the task with the new format based on the sample file structure:

1. Update research digest time to 5:30 PM KST (08:30 UTC)
2. Update research digest format (new citation style)
3. Delete wake-up and sleep reminders
4. Replace BTC alert with NYSE/NASDAQ market summary

**Andy**: Let me check the current tasks file to see what's happening:

**Andy**: I can see the issue! The task file was reverted back to the old state. The research digest is scheduled for 22:00 UTC (7:00 AM KST), not 08:30 UTC (5:30 PM KST) as you requested. Also, all the changes we made (deleting wake-up/sleep reminders, replacing BTC with NYSE/NASDAQ) are missing.

Let me fix this right now and apply all your requested changes:

<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-09T13:04:59.000Z">Thanks, just we really need to correct the schedule. It is supposed to be at 17:30 KST, UTC 8:30</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: You're right! Let me fix the schedule. The research digest should be at 5:30 PM KST (17:30 KST = 08:30 UTC).

**Andy**: I can see the issue - the schedule is currently set to `0 22 * * *` (22:00 UTC = 7:00 AM KST), but it should be `30 8 * * *` (08:30 UTC = 5:30 PM KST). Also, I need to remove the wake-up, sleep, and BTC tasks as you requested earlier. Let me fix this:

<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-09T13:09:38.000Z">A few modification needed: 
1. Cite the reference on the general summary. 
2. Expand the search to the non academic articles 
3. Maintain the key insights including the critical gaps. 
4. Exclude articles already that had been included in the previous digest. 
Good?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Got it! Let me confirm the modifications for the research digest:

✅ **1. Cite references in general summary** - Add citation markers [1] [2] [3] etc. throughout the general summary text

✅ **2. Expand to non-academic articles** - Search broader sources, not just academic journals (news, reports, blogs, industry publications)

✅ **3. Maintain key insights + critical gaps** - Keep the insights section for each article AND explicitly identify critical gaps in the field

✅ **4. Exclude previous articles** - Don't include these 5 articles from today's digest:
   - Towards the next generation of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (2025)
   - GeoAI for Humanitarian Assistance handbook chapter (2024)
   - Beyond mapping: a case for geospatial analytics (2019)
   - Opportunities and Shortcomings of AI for Spatial Epidemiology (2024)
   - Mapping the landscape and roadmap of GeoAI (2024)

Should I update the scheduled task with these new requirements now, or do you want me to run a test digest first to make sure the format is what you want?

**User**: <messages>
<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-09T13:12:11.000Z">1. For the number 3, insights per each article is not necessary. Just keep it in the general summary. 

And please update the schedules task with these new requirements. So the digest of tomorrow will be according to this new structure.</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: Perfect! So the final structure will be:

✅ **Per article:**
- Citation (AMA format)
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
- ~~Key insights~~ (REMOVED)

✅ **General Summary with:**
- Current state of research (with citations [1] [2] [3])
- Key themes and gaps (with citations)
- Critical gaps explicitly identified
- Key insights for PhD (with citations)
- Relevance to PhD proposal (with citations)

✅ **Search:** Non-academic + academic articles
✅ **Exclude:** Previous 5 articles from today

</messages>

**Andy**: Yes, you can! However, changing my name would require updating the CLAUDE.md file and possibly the trigger word for other groups. 

Currently:
- My name is "Andy" (mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
- The trigger for groups is "@Andy"

If you change my name to "Computer":
- I'll respond as "Computer"
- Group trigger would be "@Computer"

Should I update the CLAUDE.md file to change my name from Andy to Computer?

<message sender="MJ" time="2026-02-09T13:35:52.000Z">How can I change Telegram bot name to Computer?</message>
</messages>

**Andy**: To change your Telegram bot name to "Computer", you have a few options:

**1. Change the bot's display name (what users see):**
- Open Telegram and search for @BotFather
- Send `/setname` command
- Select your bot from the list
- Enter the new name: `Computer`

**2. Change the bot's username (the @username):**
- Open @BotFather
- Send `/setusername` command
- Select your bot
- Enter a new username (must end with "bot", e.g., `ComputerAssistantBot`)

**3. Change the bot's description:**
- Open @BotFather
- Send `/setdescription` command
- Select your bot
- Enter: `Computer - Your personal assistant`

**Note:** The bot's actual functionality and responses are controlled by the code, not the name in Telegram. The name change in @BotFather is just cosmetic - what users see when they interact with the bot.

Would you like me to help you with any of these changes?
